# natours
<p>It's a fictional landing page for a company that offers tours in nature. The project was created by studying the "Advanced CSS and Sass" course from Jonas Schmedtmann on the Udemy platform. <strong>The goal of this project is to practice using CSS and Sass to create a visually appealing and responsive website.</strong> Unlike many modern web development projects, <strong>this project does not include the use of flexbox or modern grid layout</strong>.</p>
